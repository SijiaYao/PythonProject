### Deliverable 1 - Project Proposal

1. Who are your customers?

    People(buyers and sellers) who want to trade second-handed vehicles.
<br/>

2. What are their needs?

    Sellers want to know how much their vehicles can be sold in the second-handed market based on the brand, model, and conditions of their vehicle.
    
    Buyers want to know the market price of a vehicle given its information on brand, model, and conditions. It will serve as a reliable price reference, and help buyers to identify overpriced or underpriced vehicles in the second-handed market.
<br/>  
  
3. What specific problem(s) will you solve?

    We will develop a model to estimate the market price of a vehicle based on the vehicle information. Specifically, sellers can input the information of their vehicle, and get a estimated price that is close to its market value, which can serve as a price reference for them to trade in the second-handed market. For buyers, they can input their desired brand, model, and condition information to get an estimated price that gives them an idea of what to expect in the second-handed market. Also, if they already have a target vehicle in the market, they can use our web based tool to see whether that vehicle is overpriced or underpriced.
<br/> 

4. Why do these problems need solved?

    Except from those experienced vehicle traders, most people are not familiar with the second-handed vehicle market, and they have no idea what is the market price for a specific vehicle. To help these individuals (both sellers and buyers) make best deals in the second-handed vehicle market, price estimation is essential and valuable.

5. Where are you going to pull the data from?
